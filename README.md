# camping.gr Project!

## Overview:

**camping.gr** is a full-stack web application where users can share and review camping sites. Inspired by Yelp, camping.gr allows campers and outdoor enthusiasts to explore a wide range of campgrounds in the Greek region, view campground details, leave reviews, and upload images. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap, this project demonstrates core web development skills such as RESTful routing, database design, and user authentication.
This project was developed to help me practice backend and frontend skills, including setting up an MVC architecture, handling form data, managing databases, and implementing secure user authentication.
